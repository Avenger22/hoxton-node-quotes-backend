# If you want to go to individual items just add an number id after / like quotes/1 gets the first quote etc

## If you want to get random object from the array you can have endpoint random-["name of the array"] and you have use it in front end etc

### You can also delete like /quotes/2 and that deletes in backend, use the response in fetch to make changes in state, same thing also for PATCH, and PUT, you can do all crud here, till now no relations db, also search work, no sorting tho
